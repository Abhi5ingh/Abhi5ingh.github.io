            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Fashion Garment Synthesis using Diffusion Models</h3>
            <p> The Fashion industry is one of the old traditional industries that have a shown massive amounts of reluctance to change and adapt to the changing tides brought by Artificial Intelligence and Technlogy. I decided to help reduce the burdens of Fashion designers by creating a tool using stable diffusion model to create any number of fashion garment,t-shirts,dresses using just a simple text-prompt or a sketch. </p>
